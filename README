Server process for the Mister Pippy twitch irc bot

It takes incoming tcp connections and talks the Fallout 4 Pip-boy Companion App protocol
through them as a client (the client-as-a-server arrangement is to NAT-punch).

Upon connecting, it authenticates the connection with a security token then connects
to the configured respective twitch chat, and accepts commands in that chat to affect the game.

Since the pip boy app can be CPU-intensive at times, we farm out the actual bot logic
and pip connection processing to worker processes.

All IRC communication is tunneled through the main process as this lets us keep a better
handle on things like global rate limits.

The master and worker processes communicate over unix sockets (so they can transfer new FDs)
with a simple newline-seperated-json message protocol.

The application is broadly split into components:
	ipc - Communication between master and workers
	irc - Communication between master and twitch chat servers
	pipserver - Accepting and authenticating new pip-boy connections
	TODO more: config, bot itself
These components don't directly interact, but make calls out to the Main class which manages
cross-communication.

Uses the following libraries:
	gevent (https://github.com/surfly/gevent) - Thread-like coroutine-based async framework
	girc (https://github.com/ekimekim/girc) - gevent-based IRC library with twitch support
	mrpippy and gpippy (https://github.com/ekimekim/mrpippy) - Pip Boy protocol client library
	various micro-libraries (https://github.com/ekimekim/pylibs) - Various (mostly-gevent-related) minor bits
