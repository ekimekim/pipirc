bot framework

split into "features", a feature is generally a single command or response or thing
features are independently configurable, enablable

subclasses of feature:
	react_to_chat - call response func when a chat msg is received
		command - call response func when a specifically structured chat msg is received
	react_to_pip - call response func when pip data is updated

bare feature allows for more complex things involving tracking state, etc

maybe have decorator behave differently registering a class vs a func?

at bot init time, scan loaded features (instances of feature) and attach them as callbacks as needed
features do not change past bot init time!
